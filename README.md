#Welcome to the Repository!

This is where I will publish my workings for the 16 Bit JavaScript Virtual Machine I'm working on as I follow [this tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fTBwD3sb5mw&list=PLP29wDx6QmW5DdwpdwHCRJsEubS5NrQ9b). I plan to use this project to further deepen my knowledge and understanding of the inner workings of computer systems.
